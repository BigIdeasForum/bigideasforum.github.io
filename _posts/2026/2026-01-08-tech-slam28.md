In this recurring program, anyone who attends tonight has a 6-7 min window to present something that might have caught their attention, something they have wondered about, a book we all should know about, etc. Formal presentations with slides and videos or getting up in front of the forum are not required. The purpose is to share ideas... but mind you: 6-7 min is a lot less time than you think!

We'll focus on AI follow-up. We will take the opportunity to revisit some of the subjects we discussed in October and November about AI and where it is going. Even if you were not present, you will benefit from what will be an interesting catch-up. And as usual, this event is also one where other subjects can be brought up, shared, and discussed

It’s fun, it’s informal, it’s fast moving. Be there!
