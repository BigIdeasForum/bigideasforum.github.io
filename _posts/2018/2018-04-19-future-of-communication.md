In less than a decade, dissemination of information went from well-defined print, radio, and TV media to social platforms and information in the cloud. 

With this came two problems: 
1. the issue of sifting through an overload of information
1. the ability of any individual to reach huge numbers of contacts with self-created news or passed-on information. The latter has facilitated the phenomenon of “fake news.”

As we are all affected by this development, we expect a very lively discussion.
