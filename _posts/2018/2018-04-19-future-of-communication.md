### Introduction

In less than a decade, dissemination of information went from well-defined print, radio and TV media to social platforms cloud information. 

With this came two problems: 
1. the issue of sifting through an overload of information
1. the ability of an individual to reach huge numbers of contacts with self-created or passed-on information. The latter has facilitating the phenomenon of “fake news.”

As we are all affected by this development, we aspect a very lively discussion.
