Future Event -- We are revisiting the subject of algorithms and will focus on the amazing applications they already have in marketing. Algorithms are the backbone in many AI-based decisions. They are not as new as we normally think, but since we normally are not aware of how and where they are used... things get iffy. 

Join us for an eye-opening presentation and discuss a field of technology that will saturate societies in the future.

Presenter: Phil
