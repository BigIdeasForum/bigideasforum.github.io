  Tonight, we are following up on a previous presentation. As just about everything in the fields of technology requires energy (power), it is a crucial element in our high-tech world. We consume a lot of it and our world comes to a stand-still if we lose it - even for a short time. We will look at how far science has taken us in making energy dependable and cheap, from the small scale like batteries to the large scale of renewable energy - and anything in between.
