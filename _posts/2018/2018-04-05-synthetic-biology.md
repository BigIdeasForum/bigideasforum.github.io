synopsis: >
  In less than a decade, dissemination of information went from well-defined print, radio and TV media to social platforms cloud information. With this came two problems: (a) the issue of sifting through an overload of information; and (b) the ability of an individual to reach huge numbers of contacts with self-created or passed-on information. The latter has facilitating the phenomenon of “fake news.” As we are all affected by this development, we aspect a very lively discussion.

### Introduction

Synthetic biology is not only about human genetics; it aims at animal husbandry, microbiology and even the environment and computers (no kidding here), just to name three important ones. While we embrace the significant advancements in diagnosing and treatment of diseases and improvements in other aspects of our lives, most also stop and wonder where it may takes us - and if that is where we want ‘to be.’ 

Expect a lively discussion.
