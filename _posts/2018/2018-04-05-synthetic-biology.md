  Synthetic biology is not only about human genetics; it aims at animal husbandry, microbiology and even the environment and computers (no kidding here), just to name three important ones. While we embrace the significant advancements in diagnosing and treatment of diseases and improvements in other aspects of our lives, most also stop and wonder where it may takes us - and if that is where we want ‘to be.’

### Introduction

Synthetic biology is not only about human genetics; it aims at animal husbandry, microbiology and even the environment and computers (no kidding here), just to name three important ones. While we embrace the significant advancements in diagnosing and treatment of diseases and improvements in other aspects of our lives, most also stop and wonder where it may takes us - and if that is where we want ‘to be.’ 

Expect a lively discussion.
