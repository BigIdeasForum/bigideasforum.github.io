Just about everything in our modern lives requires energy (power). We consume a lot of it, and it has become so crucial to our high-tech lives that the world would come to a near stand-still if we lose it -- even for a short time.

In this presentation, we will focus on numerous technologies that aim at keeping us going like the Energizer Bunny -- including wireless charging, “the holy grail” in this field.
