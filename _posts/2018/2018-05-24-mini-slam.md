### Future Event

Tonight, we deal with three subjects:

1. a new way to increase your Online Productivity
1. conclusions from the fascinating book, [Homo Deus](https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464310)
1. a look at new developments in material science. 

Each subject challenges us in different ways and we will cover a lot of ground. 

Like the TECH SLAMs, you can expect eye-opening viewpoints and lively discussions to follow. Donâ€™t miss it.

Presenter: Torben, Gary, Brant
