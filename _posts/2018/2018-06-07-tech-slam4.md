Like before, TECH SLAM evenings belong to the members of the forum. YOU choose what’s on the agenda by picking a subject you find interesting, that puzzles you, or that makes you shake your head. 

In brief 5-7 minute intros (no slides, no formality) you can start a discussion that may end up on the agenda at a future event. Come and be inspired - and have fun!

Presenter: anyone who wants to share something 

### Follow-Up

Torben presented: 
* the [Matternet M2 Drone Delivery System](https://mttr.net/product).  That subject was presented in the context of...
* a global zip code system: ["A precise, three-word address for every place on earth"](https://www.ted.com/talks/chris_sheldrick_a_precise_three_word_address_for_every_place_on_earth) (5 min video)... How a three-word zip code system can divide the entire world into 3m x 3m squares, giving every person in the world an exact postal address.

* the book ["Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence"](https://www.amazon.com/Life-3-0-Being-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1101946598/) by Max Tegmark.
