Future Event -- We looked at this troubling area in the [Fall of 2015](http://bigideasforum.info/2015/10/02/cyber-crime/), but as everyone knows, much has happened since then. Our exposure is increasing, and cyber crime is getting more and more sophisticated. In this  presentation, we will look at recent developments, examples, and “What can we do about it?” This is an evening you do not want to miss.
