Future Event -- Tonight, we go back to the Slam concept, where everyone in attendance gets a chance to make 5-7 minute short introductions/presentations on something in the technology field they have come across, are curious about, donâ€™t quite get, a book they have read or a video they have seen--anything they think might interest the Forum. It is always a lot of fun, and the most unusual things tend to come up. Not to be missed.  

So come and be inspired - and have fun!

Presenter: anyone who wants to share something
