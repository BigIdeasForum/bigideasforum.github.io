Tonight, we go back to the Slam concept, where everyone in attendance gets a chance to make 5-7 minute short introductions/presentations on something in the technology field they have come across, are curious about, don’t quite get, a book they have read or a video they have seen--anything they think might interest the Forum. It is always a lot of fun, and the most unusual things tend to come up. Not to be missed.  

So come and be inspired - and have fun!

Presenter: anyone who wants to share something 

### Follow-Up

John referred to and recommended Yuval Harari’s book: [“21 Lessons for The 21st Century”](https://www.amazon.com/Lessons-21st-Century-Yuval-Harari/dp/0525512179); seconded by Gary, who reviewed Harari’s book [“Homo Deus”](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062464345) at a previous Tech Slam. Torben referred to [Christine Legarde’s interview of Yuval Harari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5Y2CwCsnbA) (65 min, YouTube)  - A scholar definitely worth following.

Devin mentioned brain wave research and referred to Viktor Grebennikov’s work.

Mark D mention that Mazda is working on a high torque, high milage gasoline engine. Worth keeping an eye on.

Connie gave a presentation on “biologics” and “nano sponges” as one of the new fields of research within immunotherapy of cancer and auto-immune diseases. Slide presentation is [here](/assets/present/2018/biologics-nanosponges.pdf). (PDF)

Gary presented Elon Musk’s Big Falcon Moon & Mars space vehicle. Slide presentation is [here](/assets/present/2018/spacex.pdf). (PDF)

Mark D presented an article asking the question: _If you have coded yourself out of a job - so that you literally do nothing everyday - are you ethically (morally?) obligated to inform your employer of what you have done?_
It touched on our previous topics of AI and ethical questions of the next 20 years.

Torben presented “a world without password” - a new technology ([www.trusona.com](http://www.trusona.com)) for “dynamic ID” that makes passwords for login to websites a thing of the past. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhCx9KhmwGk). (YouTube)
