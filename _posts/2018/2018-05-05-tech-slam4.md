### Introduction

Like before, TECH SLAM evenings belong to the members of the forum. YOU choose whatâ€™s on the agenda by picking a subject you find interesting, that puzzles you, or that makes you shake your head. 

In brief 5-7 min intros (no slides, no formality) you can start a discussion that may end up on the agenda at a future event. Come and be inspired - and have fun!

Presenter: anyone who wants to
