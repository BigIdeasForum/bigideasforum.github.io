Future Event -- Tonight, we will take a look (again) at 3D printing, but we will make this emerging technology come alive right in front of your eyes: a 3D printer will create a product while we are together! A first for many of us.

While the printer does its work, we will introduce one of the newest areas in IT: Smart Dust. You will have to be there to get a glimpse of this amazing -- and scary -- field. 

Donâ€™t miss these two subjects.

Presenters: Brant, Torben
