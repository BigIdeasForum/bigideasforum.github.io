Tonight, we go back to the Slam concept, where everyone in attendance gets a chance to make 5-7 minute short introductions/presentations on something in the technology field they have come across, are curious about, don’t quite get, a book they have read or a video they have seen--anything they think might interest the Forum. It is always a lot of fun, and the most unusual things tend to come up. Not to be missed.  

So come and be inspired - and have fun!

Presenter: anyone who wants to share something

Also, Mark explained progress in the field of [Wireless Power Transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_power_transfer) (WPT) and mentioned that:
- Qi controllers built into most WPT systems
- More and more silicon companies (Intel, Analog Devices) are announcing products.
Different systems will be shown at CES2018.
