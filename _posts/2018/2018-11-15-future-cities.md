Future Event -- As an ever increasing part of the world's population are concentrated in cities, a number of questions are critical for the quality of life of billions of people. The participants will discuss why people want to live in an increasingly stressed environment, and the presenter will raise two questions: 

* Is there an alternative?
* Do the reasons point to what such an alternative might be? 

Expect a lively night.
