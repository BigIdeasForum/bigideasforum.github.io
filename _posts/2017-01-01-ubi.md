### Introduction

Known as UBI, universal basic income is the idea that all citizens regularly receive an unconditional sum of money, either from the government or some other public institution.

Critics point out the disincentive to work, but with AI-based robots possibly creating unemployment levels of 70-80% two decades from now, it may be the only way people can live - and society can function. 
Can it work? Is this the ultimate socialist idea? Have anyone even tried this?

Join us for a discussion about one of the greatest unknown social challenges.
