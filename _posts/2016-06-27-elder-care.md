### Introduction

### Follow-Up

(notes from Pam)
> Thank you, Connie, for the wonderful resources and information about Elder Care. The numbers of people who will be needing care is truly stunning. I really appreciated seeing your notebook and I now feel inspired to create something for my family’s use. Some of the things that I jotted down to keep in a notebook include:
> 
* Family contacts
* Insurance information
* Medical records
* Business cards
* Physical therapy
* Websites/passwords for doctor’s sites
* Test records
