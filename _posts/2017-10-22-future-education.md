### Introduction

We are all familiar with the traditional K-12 education. It has been a pillar of the Western societies for a Century, and been the foundation for the high standard of living we enjoy today.

Our challenge is that AI, robots, virtual reality, IoT - and the confluence of all of them - will change society in ways that are hard to fathom. It is almost a given that our educational system does not give students the skills and knowledge they need in a highly dynamic world. And that requires a radical change in the educational system as well.

We will look at what is needed, and how teachers, parents and students must adjust to such a world.
