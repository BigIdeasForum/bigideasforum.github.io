Long before the double helix of the DNA was discovered--and even long after--scientists have been puzzled by the fact that ‘identical twins’--also called single cell twins--develop to become ‘different’ as the grow older…given they have the exact same genetic make-up.

We will unlock this mystery, looking at how epigenes work, and discuss what influences their activity, fascinating, and scary at the same time.

Join us for a look into one of the newest fields in genetics.
