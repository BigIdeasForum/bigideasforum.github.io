synopsis: >
  This week's discussion concerns the economic, social, ethical, and public safety challenges related to our ever-increasing advances in robotics and artificial intelligence.   Autonomous and non-autonomous robots have the potential to bring about a lot of good for society (caring for the sick and elderly, enabling the disabled, increasing our lifespans and allowing a surgeon to perform surgery from a distance to name just a few) but many of us fear that without adequate control, these machines can pose a threat not just to our livelihoods but to our species.

### Introduction
 
This week's discussion concerns the economic, social, ethical, and public safety challenges related to our ever-increasing advances in robotics and artificial intelligence.   Autonomous and non-autonomous robots have the potential to bring about a lot of good for society (caring for the sick and elderly, enabling the disabled, increasing our lifespans and allowing a surgeon to perform surgery from a distance to name just a few) but many of us fear that without adequate control, these machines can pose a threat not just to our livelihoods but to our species.
 
Come see some of the latest advances in robotic technology and join us in a lively discussion regarding its pros and cons. Do you believe robots will provide a net benefit to society over time or do you think they will lead us one step closer to the apocalyptic world portrayed in The Terminator?
