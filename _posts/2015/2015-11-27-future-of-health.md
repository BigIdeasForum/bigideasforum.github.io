Medicine is rapidly becoming information technology, bringing it from science fiction to science fact. Developments like robotic surgery, computer diagnosing, lab-grown replacement organs, and death being optional are well underway. And as genetics, robotics, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence come together, the results may be here much sooner than we think and be more dramatic than we can even fathom. 

Is that progress? Where does it leave us as humans? Could we stop it if we wanted to? These and other questions will effect everyone, so we encourage people of all backgrounds and all ages to join us in this discussion.
