We have just been through a media storm during the general election; at times it seemed like a hurricane or a tornado. We will look at the interplay between the media, the public, and the polarization we have experienced in the last several years.

As with many subjects about “social” impacts, there are political undertones behind this one too, but we have always managed to steer the debates in the direction of “understanding the issues” and how they "impact us" one way or another - rather than discussing what should be done! - and we think this will be the case this afternoon, too.
