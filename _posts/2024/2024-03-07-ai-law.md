You may have heard that we (Americans) are more likely to end up in a court room than in a hospital room? That’s scary. And as we typically think of the legal system as the foundation for “justice,” emerging AI technologies in the legal field raise important questions.

AI is about to change most everything but we have not looked at what that means for a specific industry or profession. Mark D. will introduce us to how AI already has and will affect the legal profession, including some insight into how lawyers are affected. And he will outline how the profession has reacted to those effects.

This is a subject that will impact us all, and the discussion that will follows the presentation will undoubtedly be lively - and meaningful.

We hope to see a lot of you - bring friends, neighbors, etc.
