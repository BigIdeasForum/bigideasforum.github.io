Time flies - and we get older! We usually don’t think much about that fact of life because there’s nothing we can do about it. Or is there? To answer that question, we’ll take a look at what happens in our bodies at the cellular level when we age, and then hone in on what we actually can do about it.

### Follow-Up

- Presentation on ["Why Do We Age"](/assets/present/2024/2024-10-03/inflamaging.pdf) (Torben)
- Presentation on ["Small Modular Reactors (SMR)"](/assets/present/2024/2024-10-03/smr.pdf) (Bob)

As a special treat, the conversations from both presentations were recorded live then transcribed using AI.  And then those transcriptions were sent to another AI ( [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google) ) which generated interesting "interviews" discussing each topic. If you weren't able to attend in person, these comes pretty close at capturing the information and energy of both talks.  Enjoy!
