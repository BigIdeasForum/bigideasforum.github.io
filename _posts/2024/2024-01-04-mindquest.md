We will discuss the areas in society that show structural inequality and focus on the interactions between the drivers of such inequality. We will  examine if thereâ€™s any reason to think that "inequality is not a consequence of capitalism but is created by design!"

This event is a continuation of the discussion on Social Inequality from December.
