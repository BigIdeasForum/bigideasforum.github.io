The interests of shareholders normally come to mind when we think about corporations, large or small, while we rarely think about stakeholders. We will take a closer look at that in this presentation by Janice and Bob.

As the national economy as a whole is impacted by the activities of shareholders and stakeholders, we will also take a look at critical aspects of the U.S. economy, its spending and national debts as this may inspire ideas for addressing todayâ€™s and future challenges.

Bring friends and neighbors! If they havenâ€™t been to a BIF event before, they donâ€™t know what they are missing. ðŸ˜Ž
