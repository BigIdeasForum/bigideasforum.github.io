Every day has news about the explosive development in the AI/AGI field; it's hard already - and will be harder in the future - to keep up. It is nearly impossible to predict how deeply we will be affected by AI/AGI . . . so thereâ€™s nothing better than being prepared for the uncertain. 

The best time to level up your AI knowledge/skills was yesterday; the second best time?
Right now!

So, this is an opportunity to get a broader look at (1) what comprises AI/AGI, (2) where are the field and its many components heading, AND (3) should we/can we rein in and regulate the field in a meaningful way. 

Join us for an introduction to these issues and a discussion about a field that will impact all of us.

We hope to see a lot of you - bring friends, neighbors, etc.
