### Introduction

As we spend more and more time online, we often get lost in the enormous amount of data available. However, thereâ€™s help. 

Following the philosophy that we should let our computers do all the mundane and time consuming activities for us, we will take a look at what some specific apps can do in areas like searching for, gathering, and archiving information - and finding it all again.

Whether a student, working, or retired, this presentation and discussion will be of great value to you - every day.
