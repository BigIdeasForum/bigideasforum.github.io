You read it right! Humans have two “brains” and two “genomes.”

There are ten times more microorganisms in our intestinal 
tract than cells in the entire human body (30-100 trillion). Why? 

Research has uncovered a large number of health factors and functionalities of the body directly linked to the presence of the intestinal biome. Some factors are so important that they rival the “grey matter brain” and the genome itself. Considering how much you can impact this biome, you will recognize the importance of a healthy lifestyle.

Don’t miss this eye-opening presentation. 
It could actually change your life.
