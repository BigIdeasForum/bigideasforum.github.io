This is part 1 of a 2-part series dealing with living on Mars. Tonight we'll show and discuss two TED talks:

**What a Planet Needs to Sustain Life** -- It sounds like science fiction, but journalist Stephen Petranek considers it fact: within 20 years, humans will live on Mars. In this provocative talk, Petranek makes the case that humans will become a spacefaring species and describes in fascinating detail how we'll make Mars our next home. "*Humans will survive no matter what happens on Earth,*" Petranek says. "*We will never be the last of our kind.*"

**What Time is it on Mars** -- Nagin Cox is a first generation Martian.  As a spacecraft engineer at  NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Cox works on the team that manages rovers on Mars. But working  on another Planet -- whose day is 40 minutes longer than earth’s -- has particular, often comical challenges.

Join us and weigh in on the matter.
