Disruption is a buzz word often used in articles and media reports to characterize the accelerating developments in new technologies. But what are they exactly? Are all new technologies disruptive if they develop fast? If not, why are some of them disruptive and others not? How do they progress? Can we even predict them? Are there examples we can learn from? And most puzzling: Why are excellent companies most vulnerable to disruptions?

These are some of the questions that will be presented and discussed tonight, and some of the things we will learn are, to say the least, very counterintuitive.

Expect a lively night.
