Few subjects are more laden with jokes and subjective opinions than the “difference between men and women.” For many years, both scientists and laymen agreed that the differences between the denizens of Mars and Venus in terms of abilities, habits, and preferences were cultural and, therefore, not related to inherent genetic or neurological factors.

That conclusion is now being challenged.

Considerable amount of scientific data demonstrates that differences in our brain translate to differences in both behaviour and abilities.

We will look at this evidence - while taking time to share observations and some laughs but also discuss what the consequences of this new information are.

Join us for a fun, eyeopening, and undoubtedly lively evening.
