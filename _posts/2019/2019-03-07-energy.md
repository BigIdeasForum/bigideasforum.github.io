FUTURE EVENT -- This presentation is an extension of a [previous program](http://bigideasforum.info/2018/09/06/energy-2/) where new technology (or old technology in new applications) were discussed. Tonight, we will get a look into some of the projects and ideas that are being worked at Stanford. Our lives are so dependent on energy in various forms that any progress will have an impact on how we live, work, and play.

This may be the night where you will hear about projects that have not even hit the media yet.
