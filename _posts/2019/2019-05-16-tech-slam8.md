In this recurring program, anyone who attends tonight has a 6-7 min window to present something that might have caught their attention, something they have wondered about, a book we all should know about, etc. Formal presentations with slides and videos or getting up in front of the forum are not required. The purpose is to share ideas . . . but mind you: 6-7 min is a lot less than you think!

It’s fun, it’s informal, it’s fast moving. Be there!
