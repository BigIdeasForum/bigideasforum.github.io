In this recurring program, anyone who attends tonight has a 6-7 min window to present something that might have caught their attention, something they have wondered about, a book we all should know about, etc. Formal presentations with slides and videos or getting up in front of the forum are not required. The purpose is to share ideas . . . but mind you: 6-7 min is a lot less than you think!

It’s fun, it’s informal, it’s fast moving. Be there!

### Followup

Torben showed a video of a [micro-scale "bot"](/assets/present/2019/2019-05-16/microbots.mp4) that gets its motion from the thermal properties of dissimilar metals.  Also, a video of an artist working to bring attention to climate change by her incredible, massive [paintings of glacial landscapes](/assets/present/2019/2019-05-16/glacier-paintings.mp4) (she also gave a [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/zaria_forman_drawings_that_show_the_beauty_and_fragility_of_earth)). 

Pam mentioned a couple interesting books she's reading:

* ["The Brain's Way of Healing"](https://www.amazon.com/Brains-Way-Healing-Discoveries-Neuroplasticity/dp/014312837X), by Norman Doidge, MD
* ["The Brain That Changes Itself"](https://www.amazon.com/Brain-That-Changes-Itself-Frontiers/dp/0143113100/) , by Norman Doidge, MD 

MarkD presented on new information being learned about the moon, how the Internet of Things is being applied to the cattle industry, on how there's an unseen class of "ghost workers" being utilized by companies such as Google, and on new findings regarding the extent of the plastics problem in the oceans.

Craig talked about how new [electric motor technologies](/assets/present/2019/2019-05-16/craig.pdf) are offering ways to improve on the efficiency and design of airplanes.

John spoke to it being the 100th anniversary of Einstein's Theory of Relativity and mentioned the recent success by astronomers in capturing the first-ever [image of a black hole](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2019/4/19/how-scientists-captured-the-first-image-of-a-black-hole/), again, proving that Einstein was correct.

Brant gave a link to a [webinar on The Future of Healthcare](https://www.a360.digital/david-karow-post-webinar-sample-content)
 (from Peter Diamandis' Exponential Medicine initiative) that talks about a new medical screening procedure being offered by [HealthNucleus.com](https://www.healthnucleus.com) that can better assess your true state of "health" using advanced imaging, genomic sequencing, and AI/machine learning.

 Also mentioned: 

* a new [5-passenger electrically-driven air taxi](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/16/18625088/lilium-jet-test-flight-electric-aircraft-flying-car) that's currently under development that could potentially help reduce the carbon footprint of getting people around
* a new system that does real-time capture (using a 3D camera array) and analysis of your body posture and range of motion (etc) and can identify imbalances and prescribe a plan that could help a patient work to make improvements to any problems there.
