This evening, we will discuss some of the cyber threats you didn’t know existed - a follow up to the November presentation on 
 [Cybercrime & Cyber Security](http://bigideasforum.info/2015/10/02/cyber-crime/). 
 
 Most of this will be new to us, some of it is downright scary, but all of it is part of today’s life in cyber space, and we need to know what to DO about it. 

This evening will be a moderated, free-flowing, no agenda, off-the-top-of-our-heads discussion guided by three presenters who cover most aspects of this field

And really, bring friends and neighbors - including tweens and teens.

If you have specific questions you want addressed, send a note to [BigIdeasForum@gmail.com](mailto:bigideasforum@gmail.com?subject=Privacy%20Topic%20Idea) before Noon on Jan 10.


Presenters: Gary, Devin, Brant
