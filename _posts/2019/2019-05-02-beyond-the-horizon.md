FUTURE EVENT - We spend so much time on today’s issues and so little on tomorrow’s issues, that we neglect to focus on what lies beyond the horizon. That can be serious, maybe even fatal. 

Tonight's presentation is a video from a conference about what the future holds for all of us. It is a riveting, breathtaking and very humorous tour-de-force about the rapidly approaching future. With Bob’s help, Big Ideas Forum has gotten an opportunity to watch this video in a “private viewing” - which is normally only available for five-digit dollar fees. 

So, your only chance to get a glimpse of this future and be challenged, thrilled, provoked, outraged and more,  is to be at Big Ideas Forum tonight. Don’t miss it.
