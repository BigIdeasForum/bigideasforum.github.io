FUTURE EVENT -- From the moment we are born, we are so immersed in a world of sound that it is part of our very existence. We take it for granted and don’t think of it as a “field of technology.” Sure, there’s ultrasound diagnostics and sonars, but really, what else?

Actually, there are very few scientific areas where the audible/sub-audible sound is not used!

Tonight, we will take you on an unexpected adventure into incredible ways sound can help, harm, inform, and amaze: whether it's with volcanic activity predictions, weaponized sound waves and law enforcement, and then on to neutralizing ‘acoustic cookies’ with ‘ultrasound firewalls’ for mobile phones.

You will be fascinated - don’t miss out on this event.
