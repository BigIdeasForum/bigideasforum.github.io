Terms like Cell Cultivation, Stem Cells, and CRISPR-Cas9 appear more and more often in the media, but one field is so new that it is still under the radar: Synthetic biology -- the science of creating “life forms” from scratch in the laboratory, including life forms that have never existed before. We will take a look at how far scientists have come and what it holds for the future... and what we might love or hate about it. 

Join us as we explore this new horizon.
