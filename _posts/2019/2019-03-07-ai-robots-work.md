FUTURE EVENT

New technologies have always impacted our lives - for the better it seems (think of the printing press, cars, TV, computers, cell phones) but few of today’s emerging technologies have the potential to alter the way we work, or work at, all as much as intelligent robots.

Where are we heading? Is it good, not so good, or bad? Do we like what we see coming? Can we do anything about it?

We don’t know the answers yet. That makes a discussion about the impact on the future so much more important.

Don’t miss this event.
