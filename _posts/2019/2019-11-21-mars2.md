This is part 2 of a 2-part series dealing with living on Mars. 

This is the second session in a two evening series discussing preparing to live on Mars. Tonight, we'll show and discuss two TED talks:Â 

**The Living Tech We Need to Support Human Life on Other Planets** - What would it take to settle Mars? In a talk about the future of space exploration, Lynn Rothschild reviews the immense challenges to living elsewhere in the universe and proposes some bold, creative solutions to making a home off planet Earth -- like "growing" houses out of fungi or using bacteria to help generate electricity.

**Venus is too hot, Mars is too cold, and Earth is just right** says planetary scientist Dave Brain. But why? In this pleasantly humorous talk, Brain explores the fascinating science behind what it takes for a planet to host life -- and why humanity may just be in the right place at the right time when it comes to the timeline of life-sustaining planets.

Join us and weigh in on the matter.
