In this presentation, we will take a quick look at how far genetics have come in the past few years. New developments are announced almost weekly across a broad range of areas, raising hope about solutions of intractable problems on one side but raising fear about tampering with nature beyond our control.

Join the discussion about these and possible other aspects of the fascinating field of genetics.
