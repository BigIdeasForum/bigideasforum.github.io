As we spend more and more time online, we often get lost in the enormous amount of data available. However, there’s help. 

Following the philosophy that we should let our computers do all the mundane and time consuming activities for us, we will take a look at what some specific apps can do in areas like searching for, gathering, and archiving information - and finding it all again.

Whether a student, working, or retired, this presentation and discussion will be of great value to you - every day.

A number of apps allow users to search, store and retrieve information in entirely new ways; or rather, they make the computer do the work for you. We’ll take a look at these apps, and will revisit the most important in a follow-up presentation.
