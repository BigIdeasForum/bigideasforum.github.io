Swarm intelligence is part of the general “crowd wisdom” phenomenon known in nature among ants, bees, starlings, sardines and other fauna species. Artificial intelligence and robots are now being combined into new products that are self-learning and self-organizing and with algorithms that make swarms better decision makers than individuals and even experts.

At the end of the session, we will discuss if we want to experience a live swarm event (at a subsequent BIF evening) and what subject we in that case may want to ‘debate.’ It could be anything from “_What is a fair price for a ticket to a football game?_” to “_How well will the Democrats do in the 2018 election?_” - or most anything in between.

So, put your thinking caps on.
