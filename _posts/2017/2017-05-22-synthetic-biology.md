### Introduction

Can we create human body parts or even entire human beings by building them from their molecular components? Would they be alive? Would they have advantages over non-biological alternatives? 

Like in other areas of what we call progress, the questions is if it will be available to everyone, or if we can refuse it if we want to.

We will discuss this Frankenstein scenario at this evenings program. As it may well involve you one day, why not come out and discuss what is on the horizon.
