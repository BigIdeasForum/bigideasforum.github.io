In the format of the popular [Poetry Slams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry_slam), Big Ideas Forum turns into **Tech Slam** for an evening.

Each volunteering participant gets 5 minutes to introduce a book, an article, a film, a TV feature, a web posting, or any other source of information that has caught your attention in the past month. We will discuss this “breaking tech news” for an additional 5 minutes, and maybe select one of the subject for a future BIF event.

No formal presentation in front of the audience, no pressure. Just share what you are excited about.

Presenter: anyone who wants to share something
