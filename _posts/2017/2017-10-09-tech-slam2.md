### Introduction

Our first tech slam event was one of our best meetings in the last season. Everyone shared something they had read, seen, or heard about - or just found fascinating. The idea is that each participant makes brief (~5 min), informal, no pressure, no-slides-necessary introductions to a subject of his/her choice. Although there is no pressure to make an actual introduction, we learned that everyone found it refreshing - and above all - it was fun and refreshing. Don't miss this evening.

A few words about TECH SLAM may be in order:

Dubbed after the (once) popular Poetry Slams (edit: they are [still popular](http://phoenixpoet.com/calendar/month.php)) where anyone interested in reciting a poem is given a chance to stand up and do so (max. 5 min on a stopwatch - harder than you think!), TECH SLAM is a group-event where we all can present an idea/subject that interests us. It could be something we have read, heard, seen on TV or a TED Talk, etc. and that you would like the forum to explore further. Or it could be something you are just curious about but not necessarily know a lot about.
If you volunteer to give a 5 min intro - no mic, no formality, no standing in front of the forum unless you want to - you will most likely prompt a lively discussion . . . and we may decide to put the subject on the agenda for a more extensive discussion*. That doesn’t mean YOU have to do that presentation, although it does benefit the idea of the forum if many do.
The last time we had a TECH SLAM, we had one of our best events. So, put your thinking cap on; Oct. 9 is just around the corner and the night before may be too late to be creative.
As always, share this with friends and neighbors - and don’t forget the teens/young adults. It’s their future we are discussing.

Presenter: anyone who wants to
