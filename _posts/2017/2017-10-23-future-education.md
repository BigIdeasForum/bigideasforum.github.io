We are all familiar with the traditional K-12 education. It has been a pillar of the Western societies for a century and has been the foundation for the high standard of living we enjoy today.

Our challenge is that AI, robots, virtual reality, IoT--and the confluence of all of them--will change society in ways that are hard to fathom. It is almost a given that our educational system does not give students the skills and knowledge they need in a highly dynamic world. And that requires a radical change in the educational system as well.

We will look at what is needed and how teachers, parents, and students must adjust to such a world.
