Forever is a long time. But from today’s perspective of 76-81 years lifespans, 200-500 years may seem like forever. Biotechnology and medical sciences has made head-spinning advances in the understanding of why we age, and what we  possibly can do about it.

We will look at how close we are to realize the dream of eternal youth and debate whether or not that is a good idea at all. We all have a stake in it, so don’t miss this Pro-and-Con debate.
