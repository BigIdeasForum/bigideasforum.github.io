Transportation is rapidly becoming a high-tech industry. Self-driving cars will soon be on the streets, but mass transportation is the next big step. There are high speed trains in many parts of the world but Elon Muskâ€™s [hyperloop project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop), with underground corridors on both the East and West coast, has gained much attention and test runs are well underway. We will discuss what impact it may have on the future of transportation, city planning, etc.
