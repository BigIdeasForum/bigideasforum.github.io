### Introduction

We are growing accustomed to the fact that having our activities recorded is an inevitable part of life in the digital age. But we may not realize how far this has already come and how much farther emerging technologies can go.

Are we willing to live with that? If not, can we defend ourselves against it? Do we even know who has access to all that information?

These and many more questions will be discussed tonight - donâ€™t miss it!
