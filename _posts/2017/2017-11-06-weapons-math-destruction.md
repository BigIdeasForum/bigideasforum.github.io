synopsis: >
  AI algorithms are used extensively in loan applications, credit scores, having your CV examined during a job search, being accepted into a university program, etc. But algorithms are only what programmers make them into, and that may, at best, not be ideal and may even be destructive. We look at what algorithms are from a general point of view and how they are used more specifically. The discussion will center around how this phenomenon might harm individuals and perpetuate social biases. None of us is untouched by this already widespread use of (early stage) artificial intelligence. Be there on this night and contribute to the discussion.

### Introduction

AI algorithms are used extensively in loan applications, credit scores, having your CV examined during a job search, being accepted into a university program, etc.

But algorithms are only what programmers make them into, and that may, at best, not be ideal and may even be destructive. We look at what algorithms are from a general point of view and how they are used more specifically. The discussion will center around how this phenomenon might harm individuals and perpetuate social biases.

None of us is untouched by this already widespread use of (early stage) artificial intelligence. Be there on this night and contribute to the discussion.

Presenter: John & Torben

### Follow-Up

The following TED talks were referenced in the presentation:

*  [“The era of blind faith in big data must end”](https://www.ted.com/talks/cathy_o_neil_the_era_of_blind_faith_in_big_data_must_end) - Cathy O'Neil (13 mins)
	* Algorithms decide who gets a loan, who gets a job interview, who gets insurance and much more -- but they don't automatically make things fair. Mathematician and data scientist Cathy O'Neil coined a term for algorithms that are secret, important and harmful: "weapons of math destruction." Learn more about the hidden agendas behind the formulas.

Other talks that are highly recommended:

* ["How I’m fighting bias in algorithms"](https://www.ted.com/talks/joy_buolamwini_how_i_m_fighting_bias_in_algorithms) - Joy Buolamwini (9 mins) 
	* MIT grad student Joy Buolamwini was working with facial analysis software when she noticed a problem: the software didn't detect her face -- because the people who coded the algorithm hadn't taught it to identify a broad range of skin tones and facial structures. Now she's on a mission to fight bias in machine learning, a phenomenon she calls the "coded gaze." It's an eye-opening talk about the need for accountability in coding ... as algorithms take over more and more aspects of our lives.
* ["How algorithms shape our world"](https://www.ted.com/talks/kevin_slavin_how_algorithms_shape_our_world) - Kevin Slavin (15 mins)
* [“The moral bias behind your search results”](https://www.ted.com/talks/andreas_ekstrom_the_moral_bias_behind_your_search_results) - Andreas Ekström (9 mins)
* [“How I hacked online dating"](https://www.ted.com/talks/amy_webb_how_i_hacked_online_dating) Amy Webb: (17 mins) - Very entertaining!
* [“The influence of algorithms”](https://www.ted.com/playlists/323/the_influence_of_algorithms) - a playlist
	* Algorithms play a big part in our day-to-day lives. From search engines to architecture, explore how these formulas affect the way we view and interact with the world around us. (44 kB)
