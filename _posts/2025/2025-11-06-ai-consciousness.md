Researchers at the four big tech companies have recently expressed concern that AI systems (robots) can (1) contemplate AND carry out activities that they have not been programmed for and which might conflict with the objectives of the owner; (2) refuse to carry out specific orders/instructions; (3) they may start using a language we don’t understand. That raises the question of whether AI systems understand what they are doing, and if they could take control of our world as we know it.

Join us for a fascinating and accessible discussion about what these developments in artificial intelligence might mean for all of us. We’ll explore questions like: Can machines really think for themselves? What happens if they stop following our instructions? And how might this affect everyday life in the years ahead? You don’t need a technical background—just curiosity and an open mind. This event is a chance to hear new ideas, share your thoughts, and take part in a conversation that’s shaping our shared future.
