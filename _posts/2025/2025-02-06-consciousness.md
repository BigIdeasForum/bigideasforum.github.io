Two towering scientists, David Chalmers and Anil Seth, will present their views of the nature and origin of consciousness, whether AI-bots one day can be conscious, and related issues. Alas, they were both busy on that day 🙂  However, we got the second best: An interview with both by Brian Greene, which runs 45 min and leaves plenty of time to discuss what comes to your mind . . . whatever mind is!
