The “Enough” philosophy invites us to embrace contentment with what we already have. It encourages us to appreciate our lives and find joy in the present, rather than chasing endless growth or material possessions. By focusing on gratitude and sufficiency, we can cultivate happiness and well-being without the pressures of consumerism. 

We will explore this movement, examine its principles, and see whether it might lead to a more fulfilling life.
