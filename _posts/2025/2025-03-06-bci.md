The brain is perhaps the last barrier to a full understanding of the human body. From scannings to direct implants... we will take a look at how far we have come to unlock the mysteries of the workings of the brain, and then reflect on whether the results of what we might learn is a good thing.

### Follow-Up

* ["Brain-Computer Interfaces"](/assets/present/2025/2025-03-06/bci.pdf) (PDF, Torben)
* [AI-Powered Brain Implant Lets Paralyzed Man Control Robotic Arm](https://neurosciencenews.com/ai-robot-arm-bci-neurotech-28471/) - we are heading toward controlling (a) external devices and (b) our limbs with our minds (Kevin)

### Coming Up...

- Apr 3: The “Enough” philosophy about growth, economy, and wellness living
- May 1: TechSlam (incl. follow-up on Consciousness/Brain/Computer Interface)
- June 5: TechSlam (end of Spring season)
