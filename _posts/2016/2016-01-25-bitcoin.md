### Introduction

What is the role of Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies in our future, and (by the way) what is Bitcoin? Is Bitcoin technology simply an unstable financial vehicle intended for clandestine or illicit commerce, or does it have broader economic application? 

“Control of currency is one of the most important tools a government wields.” The world is changing. Sweden is presently the most cash-free society in the world, and Ecuador will soon host the first-ever state-run electronic payment system. How should we view the world economy’s drift away from notes and coins in favor of digital currencies? 

Join us on January 25, 2015 for a discussion based on the book The Age of Cryptocurrency by Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey.
