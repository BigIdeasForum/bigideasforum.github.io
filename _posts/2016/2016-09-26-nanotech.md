In less than a decade, nanotechnology has become one of the most prolific and promising technologies of our times.

Working on the [nanoscale](https://www.nano.gov/nanotech-101/what/nano-size) (billionth of a meter) opens tremendous perspective for material science, constructing new devices that will make todayâ€™s miniaturizing pale in comparison.

Whether applied in computers, wearable technology, biology, medical implants or other fields, nanotechnology will accelerate advances in seemingly unrelated cutting edge technologies.

Join us for an eye-opening presentation and discussion.
