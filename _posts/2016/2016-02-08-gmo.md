### Introduction

Genetically Modified Organisms, or GMOs, have become part of our everyday life and are becoming commonplace in our everyday foods. 
Is it as good an idea as proponents claim or should we be as careful as the opponents claim?

Following a brief presentation about the science behind GMOs, “a proponent” and “an opponent” will present ‘for and against’ arguments (not necessarily their own). Based on these arguments, participants will discuss and weigh in on the arguments, and come up with new ones.

Presenter: Torben & Marcia
