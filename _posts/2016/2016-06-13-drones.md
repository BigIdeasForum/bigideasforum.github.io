The [Reaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Atomics_MQ-9_Reaper) and the [Predator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Atomics_MQ-1_Predator) became household names when drones became the latest military technology. They were originally called Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and come as remotely controlled or entirely autonomous flying vehicles. This opened new ethical aspects of warfare.

But drones soon found their way into commercial applications (like the Amazon drone delivery program) and public/consumer entertainment domains where drones were the most popular gift item at Christmas 2016.

With drones fitted with cameras being widely available, the public has a tool that opens up doors to a birds-eye-view of the world (the military and Google already have that) - but that comes with some serious concerns about privacy. Are we willing to sacrifice privacy for having fun? 

This and many other questions are on debate in this eveningâ€™s program.
