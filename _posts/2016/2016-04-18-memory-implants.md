Understanding how the brain works have already led to significant improvement in “neurological health" such as “pacemaker implants" to control Parkinson’s disease. But with this understanding comes the ability to manipulate the brain, perhaps upload memory from a hard drive or to download memory from the brain to an external device--as suggested the Matrix movie. Transfer of thoughts between Man and Machine have already been demonstrated, and with the accelerating miniaturization of chips, the implant of chips in the brain that communicated with the Internet is on the horizon. 


We may not like that development, but the idea has been “planted” (pun intended) and will become a reality, for better or worse, in a decade.

This raises some serious social questions. Be there and make your voice heard... or just send your thoughts!
