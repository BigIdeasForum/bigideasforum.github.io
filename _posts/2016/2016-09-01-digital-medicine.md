### Introduction

Digital Medicine: Transforming Science Fiction into Science Fact

How would you like . . . 
- a robot doing major surgery on you?
- a computer diagnosing you via a smart phone?
- replacement organs grown in a lab or bones made by 3D-printing?
- designer babies?
- death being optional?

Medicine is rapidly becoming information technology, bringing it from science fiction to science fact. The mentioned developments are well underway and with the confluence of genetics, robotics, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence the results may be here much sooner than we think and be more dramatic than we can even fathom. 

Is that progress? Where does it leave us as humans? Could we stop it if we wanted to? 

After a brief introduction, we will discuss these and other questions about the future of medicine. For those interested in a preview into the subject, two books by Eric Topol, MD are good sources: 
1. [“The Patient Will See You Now: The Future of Medicine Is In Your Hands”](https://www.amazon.com/Patient-Will-See-You-Now/dp/0465040020/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1516199797&sr=8-1&keywords=the+patient+will+see+you+now) (2015)
2. [“The Creative Destruction of Medicine: How the Digital Revolution Will Create Better Health Care”](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Destruction-Medicine-Digital-Revolution/dp/0465061834/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1516199858&sr=1-2) (2013).

These subjects will effect everyone, and people of all backgrounds and all ages are encouraged to participate in this discussion.
