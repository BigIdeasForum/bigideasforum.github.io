We are taking a new look at climate change - perhaps the most hotly debated subject today. To increase our understanding of it, we will look at our climate in a geological/historical context, see what modern climate models can tell us, and then go into ice ages and glacial issues, oceanography, thawing tundras, albedo feedback - and the role of CO2 in all of it.

Donâ€™t miss this chance to get an up-to-date look at these complex issues. Join us for an eye-opening presentation and an opportunity to get answers to you questions.
