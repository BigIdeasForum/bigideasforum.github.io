In this second presentation by Robert Miller, finance professor emeritus, we will look at two of the lesser known stock transactions that corporations engage in with the cash they generate through their normal operations:

* Dividends: Use some of the cash to pay out dividends to its shareholders
* Stock buybacks: Use cash to repurchase some stock that had been previously issued

We will examine and discuss how these transactions take place, and what the implications are for corporations, stock prices, and shareholders. 

Whether you are managing your portfolio yourself or you have a manager to look after your portfolio, you want to know about these transactions and what they mean for you.

We have had previous meetings of this nature on ZOOM. Although nothing is better than meeting face to face, we have found previous ZOOM meetings of this nature quite effective and with plenty of room for interaction.

We hope to see you there.
