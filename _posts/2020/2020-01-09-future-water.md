Living on a planet that is 3/4 covered by oceans, water shouldnâ€™t be an issue. But around the world, we experience either too little or too much water. Why is that? Is there anything we can do about it? 

Quantity is one thing - quality is a completely different issue, and on that, we can have some control over water.

We will discuss these and other aspects of the future of water.  Join us for a debate on an issue that is more critical to all of us than we generally think.
