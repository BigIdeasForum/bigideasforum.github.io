While we often devote some time to discuss implications (and our concerns) regarding the Big Ideas that our presenters explore with us in our bi-weekly sessions, this week our big idea will be fully devoted to a (hopefully lively) discussion of concerns vis-à-vis one of the biggest technological breakthroughs of the last few years. That is, the ubiquitous internet in all of its forms and functions – information and disinformation; communication and clutter; marketing and exploitation. 

In 90 minutes, we will try to cover a lot of ground. Spoiler alert: yes this will be about censorship. Second spoiler alert: we won’t resolve the issues but we will instead try to explore what many of these difficult issues are. Your presenter will endeavor to present the issues; we hope you will come ready to offer your own Big Ideas on the topic. 

Presenter: Mark
