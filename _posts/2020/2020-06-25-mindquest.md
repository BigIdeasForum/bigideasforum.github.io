### Nature’s Medicine Cabinet

Western medicine has opened up to the overwhelming evidence that natural products have significant medical benefits; among them are overall wellness, boosted immune system (incl. protection against viruses), improved mood and mental health, better sleep, and reduction in stress levels.
With the help of technology, the active ingredients in these products are now available in pure form like essential oils. 

As we all deal with some “issues,” you don’t want to miss this informative and eye-opening presentation.

Thursday, June 25 at 6:30 to 8:00 pm

Event is FREE; registration not needed.  
Location: Anthem Civic Building
3701 W Anthem Way (at the SE corner of N Venture Dr.)
