Critical race theory (CRT) is a framework for examining the ways in which race and racism intersect with systems of power in society. It originated in the field of legal studies as a response to the limitations of traditional civil rights approaches to addressing racial inequality. CRT posits that racism is not only the result of individual prejudice or bias, but is also embedded in the laws, policies, and practices of societal institutions. It also recognizes the intersectionality of race with other forms of identity such as gender, class, and sexuality. The goal of CRT is to identify and challenge the ways in which systemic racism perpetuates inequality and to work towards social justice and equity.
