Text-to-image generator AI programs are a type of machine learning technology that can create realistic images from textual descriptions. These programs use complex algorithms and neural networks to analyze and interpret natural language descriptions and generate corresponding images. Text-to-image generators have a wide range of potential applications, from helping artists and designers visualize their ideas to creating realistic simulations for scientific research.

We continue our survey of current trends in AI by looking into several of these. (e.g. DALL-E)
