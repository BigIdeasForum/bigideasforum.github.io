### Follow-Up

From Brant:

* The power of music - “Alive Inside” - http://www.aliveinside.us
 
* Edward de Bono - Thinking is a skill, not a trait. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_de_Bono
            His theories on the mind might be just that, theories, but his books can be enlightening for someone new to this stuff
	* Six Thinking Hats -
            http://www.amazon.com/Six-Thinking-Hats-Edward-Bono/dp/0316178314
	* deBono’s Thinking Course -
            http://www.amazon.com/Bonos-Thinking-Course-Revised-Edition/dp/0816031789
	* Lateral Thinking: Creativity Step by Step - developing the “green hat” (in Six Hats parlance). Not the best reviews here, but still a good introduction on the topic
