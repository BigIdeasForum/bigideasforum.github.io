In this recurring program, anyone who attends tonight has a 6-7 min window to present something that might have caught their attention, something they have wondered about, a book we all should know about, etc. Formal presentations with slides and videos or getting up in front of the forum are not required. The purpose is to share ideas... but mind you: 6-7 min is a lot less time than you think!

It’s fun, it’s informal, it’s fast moving. Be there!

### Follow-Up

We had two subjects on the agenda:

1) The progress of Elon Musk’s Neuralink, with amazing [photos of how the chips are implanted in the brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YreDYmXTYi4&t=5232s).
