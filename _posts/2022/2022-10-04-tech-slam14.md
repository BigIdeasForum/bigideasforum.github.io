In this recurring program, anyone who attends tonight has a 6-7 min window to present something that might have caught their attention, something they have wondered about, a book we all should know about, etc. Formal presentations with slides and videos or getting up in front of the forum are not required. The purpose is to share ideas... but mind you: 6-7 min is a lot less time than you think!

It’s fun, it’s informal, it’s fast moving. Be there!

### Follow-Up

Topics discussed:

1) APS and energy supply; nuclear energy plants; future of energy
2) Light based Internet connection (called LiFi)
3) How DNA works (in real time and seen through electron microscope)
4) Icebergs: Haunting photos of polar ice (don’t miss the end)
5) Genius Music (seen by some of you before)
