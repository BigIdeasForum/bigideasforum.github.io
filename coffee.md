JOIN US FOR BIG IDEAS COFFEE

EVERY TUESDAY at 3:00 PM at Amped Coffee [^1]

Big Ideas started over a cup of coffee back in 2015, and we have met just about every week since then. It has grown into a mini-forum with a varying number of people. We have fun, get inspired and â€“ as always â€“ get informed. Itâ€™s not always about science and technology; it can be anything â€“ but it's always fun-filled and inspiring.

Everyone is welcome and you donâ€™t need to let anyone know if you are coming or not. Come at 3 PM or later if it suits you better; we rarely stay much beyond than 5 PM-ish. The best way to wrap up your day is with a cup of Amped coffee and some big ideas among freinds.

See you there!

Oh! Amped likes that we bring our own cups (saves plastic/paper) . . . and they donâ€™t have to wash it afterwards ðŸ˜‰ but you can always get theirs.

[^1]: [Amped Coffee](http://ampedcoffeeco.com) is  located behind Circle K on the north-east corner of Anthem Way and Gavilan Peak (close to Ace Hardware store).
