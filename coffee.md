JOIN US FOR BIG IDEAS COFFEE

EVERY TUESDAY at 3:00 PM at Amped Coffee [^1]

Big Ideas started over a cup of coffee back in 2015, and we have met just about every week since then. It has grown into a mini-forum with a varying number of people. We have fun, get inspired and â€“ as always â€“ get informed. Itâ€™s not always about science and technology; it can be anything â€“ but it's always fun-filled and inspiring.

The best way to wrap up your day is with a cup of Amped coffee and some big ideas among friends. Everyone is welcome and you donâ€™t need to let anyone know whether you are coming or not. Come at 3 PM - or later if that suits you better; we rarely stay beyond 5 PM. See you there!

Oh, by the way! Although you can always ask for Ampedâ€™s real cups (and should: it saves plastic/paper), they do like it when we bring our own cups... so they donâ€™t have to wash it afterwards ðŸ˜‰.

[^1]: [Amped Coffee](http://ampedcoffeeco.com) is  located behind Circle K on the north-east corner of Anthem Way and Gavilan Peak (close to Ace Hardware store).
