# Future Events

## Oct. 3: MindQuest: Why do we age? The science of senescent cells

Time flies - and we get older! We usually don’t think much about that fact of life because there’s nothing we can do about it. Or is there? To answer that question, we’ll take a look at what happens in our bodies at the cellular level when we age, and then hone in on what we actually can do about it.

If time allows, we’ll discuss other subjects that the audience brings up.

## Nov. 7: Polarization, The Media, & The Public

We have just been through a media storm during the general election; at times it seemed like a hurricane or a tornado. We will look at the interplay between th media, the public, and the polarization we have experienced in the last several years.

Although is may seem so, this will not be a political discussion.

## Dec 5: Where are we with AI/AGI/AI Assistants?

It’s less than two years ago that AI/AGI and ChartBots became household names. Now it seems like we cannot go about our lives and businesses without it. Are we being gaslighted or are we on the way to become totally dependent on these must-have, non-human interactions? 

Bring your views and experience to this event - and if you don’t have any yet . . . well, that’s even more of a reason to come.

## Jan 2: The status on brain-computer interface

The brain is perhaps the last barrier to a full understanding of the human body. From scannings to direct implants . . . we will take a look at how far we have come to unlock the mysteries of the workings of the brain, and then reflect on whether the results of what we might learn is a good thing.  

If time allows, we’ll discuss other subjects that the audience brings up.

## Feb 6: The biggest discoveries in science in 25 years

We will discuss some of the biggest, and hardest to comprehend discoveries in science in the last 2-3 decades. It’s not the objective that you will understand the subject; rather it’s meant to dazzle you by human ingenuity, what’s even possible to conceive, and then “construct/measure.”

Feel free to bring your own list of discoveries - it may well differ from the presenters, and we may have a follow up session.
