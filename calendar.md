# Future Events

## Dec 5: Where are we with AI/AGI/AI Assistants?

It’s less than two years ago that AI/AGI and ChartBots became household names. Now it seems like we cannot go about our lives and businesses without it. Are we being gaslit or are we on the way to become totally dependent on these must-have, non-human interactions? 

Bring your views and experience to this event - and if you don’t have any yet... well, that’s even more of a reason to come.

## Jan 2: The biggest discoveries in science in 25 years

We will discuss some of the biggest, and hardest to comprehend discoveries in science in the last 2-3 decades. It’s not the objective that you will understand the subject; rather it’s meant to dazzle you by human ingenuity, what’s even possible to conceive, and then “construct/measure.”

Feel free to bring your own list of discoveries - it may well differ from the presenters, and we may have a follow up session. 

## Feb 6: The Origin of Consciousness

Two towering scientists, David Chalmers and Anil Seth will present their views of the nature and origin of consciousness, whether AI-bots one day can be conscious, and related issues. Alas, they were both busy on that day :)  However, we got the second best: An interview with both by Brian Greene, which runs 45 min and leaves plenty of time to discuss what comes to your mind... whatever mind is!

## Mar 6: The status on brain-computer interface

The brain is perhaps the last barrier to a full understanding of the human body. From scannings to direct implants... we will take a look at how far we have come to unlock the mysteries of the workings of the brain, and then reflect on whether the results of what we might learn is a good thing.  

If time allows, we’ll discuss other subjects that the audience brings up.

## Apr 3: The “Enough” philosophy about growth, economy, and wellness living

The “Enough” philosophy invites us to embrace contentment with what we already have. It encourages us to appreciate our lives and find joy in the present, rather than chasing endless growth or material possessions. By focusing on gratitude and sufficiency, we can cultivate happiness and well-being without the pressures of consumerism.

We will explore this movement, examine its principles, and see whether it might lead to a more fulfilling life.
