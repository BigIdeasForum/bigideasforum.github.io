# Future Events - 2025

## Dec 4: TechSlam

energy, water, climate+ follow up on the past events

# Future Events - 2026

## Jan 8 - Tech Slam - 

Will focus on AI follow-up. We will take the opportunity to revisit some of the subjects we discussed in October and November about AI and where it is going. Even if you were not present, you will benefit from what will be an interesting catch-up. And as usual, this event is also one where other subjects can be brought up, shared, and discussed.  

## Feb 5 - The life and Impact of Nicola Tesla

## Mar 5 - "Red Hat" - The Psychology of Disagreeing

## Apr 2 - Viewpoint theory

We all have viewpoints, and without a doubt, our own ones are the best. What’s there to discuss? Do we really need a theory on that?
Well, there’s a lot to understand about how viewpoints develop and how we deal with cognitive dissonance. Based on Dorothy E. Smith’s “Viewpoint theory” and the recently discussed “Red Hat” Cognitive Dissonance, we will discuss how much we all would benefit from understanding the processes that touch every single one of us.
It may sound like a dry subject, but be prepared for an exciting discussion.

## May 7 - We are not special

Humans and animals have a lot in common

In a time of extraordinary technological developments, it’s easy to think that humans are special. We haven’t even found any sign of life outside the Third Rock from the Sun. But a closer look, starting with Jane Goodall’s discoveries in 1960 that chimpanzees use tools and continuing up until today, many aspects of the natural world prove that even though we do not need to feel demoted, we are not alone in possessing “human” qualities, be it intellectual, behavioral, and emotional. Join us in opening our eyes to a wider perspective of existence. 

## June 4: TBD (possibly "AI and Psychosis”)
