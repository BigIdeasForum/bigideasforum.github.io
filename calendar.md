# Future Events - 2026

## Mar 5 - Viewpoint Theory & 'Red Hat’

We’ll delve into Dorothy E. Smith’s theory about how our place in society forms and influences our perspectives and lives. We'll follow up by looking at the so-called 'Red Hat' dissonance, about why the public dialogue has become dysfunctional in recent years and what we can do about it. There are important lessons for everyone.

## Apr 2 - TBD

## May 7 - Humans are not special

In this presentation, we'll look at how research—-from Jane Goodall’s work to today’s intelligence research—-has revealed that many animals have characters and capacities similar to humans, and what that means for our perspectives on life. 

## June 4: TBD
