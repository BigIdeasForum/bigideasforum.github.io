# Future Events

## Mar 6: The status on brain-computer interface

The brain is perhaps the last barrier to a full understanding of the human body. From scannings to direct implants... we will take a look at how far we have come to unlock the mysteries of the workings of the brain, and then reflect on whether the results of what we might learn is a good thing.  

If time allows, we’ll discuss other subjects that the audience brings up.

## Apr 3: The “Enough” philosophy about growth, economy, and wellness living

The “Enough” philosophy invites us to embrace contentment with what we already have. It encourages us to appreciate our lives and find joy in the present, rather than chasing endless growth or material possessions. By focusing on gratitude and sufficiency, we can cultivate happiness and well-being without the pressures of consumerism.

We will explore this movement, examine its principles, and see whether it might lead to a more fulfilling life.
