Dear Forum member,
We want to put you to work!

As you know, one of the purposes of the TECH SLAM was to generate ideas for what we might want to discuss on future BIF evenings.

On that list were:

	Solar Roadways
	Visual technology (looking around corners)
	Energy generated from condensation
	Building IT gadgets with simple components (Raspberry Pi)


A few subjects have already been slated for BIF events; they are:

	Weapons of Math Destruction
	Swarm intelligence 
	Bio printing
	Micro-plastic pollution
	Brain-Machine Interface (NeuraLink)
	Chaos Theory
	The Burning Man phenomenon 
and we have a “back-up” list that includes:

	Deep Mind
	Underwater colonization
	Voice editing
	Synthetic biology
	Machine learning
	The Stealing of America - hacking and voter scam Future energy - update 

Furthermore, we want to refer to the subjects we have covered since we started BIF events in 2015. Many of the fields of science and technology discussed in the past have changed dramatically and would be worth revisiting - besides, our Forum has changed over the years, too.

The list of previous subjects is attached to this mail for your inspiration.

The idea here is to learn from all the members which subjects you have a preference for. Remember, it’s your forum!

Pick 3-5-10 subjects from the lists above and from the list of earlier subjects. Then, drop us a mail in the near future or bring a list with your suggestions on Monday.

We look forward to your input

Best - and see you on Oct. 22,
Brant, Gary and Torben
