Future Event -- Just about everything in our modern lives requires energy (power). We consume a lot of it, and it has become so crucial to our high-tech world that ‘life' would come to a near stand-still if we lose it - even for a short time.

In this presentation, we will focus on wireless charging -- “the holy grail” in dealing with all the devices that require energy -- from small scale batteries to electric cars and everything in between.

Presenter: Mark D.
