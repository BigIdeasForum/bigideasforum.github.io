### Introduction

Breaking into someone’s privacy - hacking in the digital world - has become a daily phenomenon, and it rightly scares most people. We are vulnerable because we don’t know how to protect ourselves against hackers who seem to be ahead of even the most sophisticated security system. So, what can we do individually and, perhaps, collectively.

We will take a look at where the threats are coming from and how much we can do to minimize our exposure.

A single new idea discussed tonight can be of significant value to anyone - so don’t miss this evening’s discussion.

Presenter: ?? -- Did we do this???
