## AI, Robots, and the Future of Jobs


### GENERAL OVERVIEW


1. “US is on the brink of economic and social upheaval due to automation putting people out of work.” Blue ribbon panel report presented to President Lyndon Johnson in 1964.


2. What’s different this time: Exponential acceleration, Cognitive Capability. Machine Learning and Decision Making. Thinking, learning, adapting.


3.  40% of robots today are in auto industry. "45% of jobs disappear in twenty years.” Elon Musk predicts AI will equal or exceed human intelligence in twenty years.


4. ROUTINE, REPETITIVE, PREDICTABLE tasks are the jobs most easily eliminated. Lawyers, Surgeons, Radiologists, Pharmacists???
		-How reconcile same number of bank tellers today as when the ATM was introduced.


5. Human skills presently thought beyond scope of AI: Empathy, Creativity, Intuition, Critical Thinking.


6. Issue of universal basic income is a core or peripheral issue, depending on expert, to the notion of AI and meaningful work. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs as well.
